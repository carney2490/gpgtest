Questions:

1. Username - do you want to use email or an identifying number such as student ID number? Or have students make up a user name.
2. Password - simple or complicated?
3. Do I have to integrate this using javascript, because using html seems way less complicated?
4. Google makes it more complicated than facebbok. (not a question just an observation)
5. Should I break my computer using a hammer, or a torch?
6. Should the login screen be separate from the 'register new user' screen?
7. Should we do an edit profile screen? In case of users who change passwords or emails.
